# Pesto Assignments

Assignment - 3 from the Week 1 - Summary of Product Mindset

## Requirements gathering

Clearly understand the high level requirements and create logical chunks of functional requirements out of them.

Try to identify the missing pieces from the initially received information.

Understand who all will be using the system for what purpose.

Also think of issues, how do we plan the rollbacks if needed.

It's good to be extra ordinary and go beyond what is asked for. Just simply convey/ explain what the new things coming to the customer & get them agreed upon.

Understand the backlogs and roadmaps well & try to complete them in an appropriate timeframe.

# Design Thinking

Design thinking is a way of teaching engineers how to approach problems creatively, like designers do. It is always a good way to come up with ideas & turn them into prototypes understanding the ideology behind the product.

The beauty of design thinking is that it can solve challenges/ complex problems. It is an actionable approach which can be used to tackle the world’s wickedest of problems. It encourages user-centricity, creativity, innovation, and out-of-the-box thinking.

A mature critical thinker can define project goals, define timelines, set expectations, manage expectations, handle conflicts and work collaboratively with a team to accomplish the project goals.

### Understanding your Customer

Understanding the customer well is a step towards knowing the requirements. By doing so, we'll be aware of what makes the customer happy and what are their habits.

It is really a good practie to know the customer's lifecycle & to take timely feedbacks.

Conform to the core values of your organization while dealing with them, think a solution that would create a win-win situation for both of the parties.

Provide customers a world class service to make them happy and feel satisfied getting the product.

### Understanding your Business

Understand the revenue model & who propses what value in it, so that we can think of how the value chain would be continued.

#### Understanding your Mission/Vision

Set an end goal, plot the milestones and get started with them. Keeping flexible approaches would help here to make continuous improvement.

## 5 Stages of Design Thinking Process

- **Empathize:** build an empathy for users that should respond to human needs. Get clear idea about the problem & the enough amount of details about it so that customer should get satisfied with the final product.

- **Define:** define the logical pieces out of requirements collected.

- **Ideate:** try to discuss over all the possible solutions for the problem across the peers.

- **Prototype and Test:** Choose one idea to actually create, and make a "rough draft" including all the possible test cases & enlist them.

- **Implement and Improve:** go ahead with the implementation, gather feedback from the end user, and repeat any earlier steps to refine your product

### Non Functional Requirements

## Security and Observability

The security responsibility comes with a product design by default. The designer need to think & ensure that the customer's data won't be compromised at all.


## Engineering Values

Leadership & conforming to the objectives to recognize the opportunities for it, be a leader at times are the core values of engineering.

A good leader is capable of managing the change/ crisis well, he empowers the Team whenever necessary and humbly collaborates with everyone.

## Working Remotely

While working remotely, you need to take ownership of your work and communicate with others if really required, respecting the timezones. Keep notes of meetings and track work with the help of appropriate tools for time, task management.

## Communication is the key to influence

- Have strong self-awareness and effective communications skills.

- Work on strengthening your foundations, be a learner even for the known things, it always help knowing what is unknown.

- Reach out to help & seek help from others.

## Key attributes for a Leader in Tech

- Be an example, educate yourself and others continuously, be a mentor/ coach as much as possible, inspire others

## Being a rockstar engineer

- Love your work, continuous rafactoring & improvements in code, use design patterns and write tests, focus on reusability, write maintainable code, know your own foundation and limits, be consistent about the things


### Points to remember

- Similarly, if you want to achieve something significant, in terms of work or recognition. You have to work incessantly and continuously towards it.

- Any progress made towards some objective, however small, in a consistent way will ultimately achieve all its goals.

- So just like this, in real life also, precision matters a lot. The more precise you are about your intention and communication, the more efficient and frictionless you become.

- It means you are paying attention and spending time fully to the task at hand.

- You don’t rely on instant gratification anymore you simply ignore it

- Most importantly, once you have decided this is what you should do, you should not worry about how you are feeling min to min or day to day for that task.

- Some Days you will feel good, and some other not so good. But if you can maintain the involvement irrespective of feelings, no one deny you success :)

- India which says “With every failure in your life you can either get wounded or get wiser.. The choice is yours”

- You also need to learn how to look at something without a preducie based on the knowledge you have. Even if you have done the same many times over.

- Having a beginner’s mindset all the time is what separates leaders from the rest. Be it in technical field or business.
